COMMENTS FROM THE INSTRUCTOR:

There's some good stuff in here, Justin! Some comments:

1. I couldn't tell how the evolution of the project went because you 
   didn't have git set up until after the project was all done. You
   should have taken care of that sooner.

2. You didn't have a .gitignore file in there to ignore the .ctxt and
   .class files created. I added one there for you.

3. You set song duration as a string like I did, and decided to just
   take the first character as a number, assuming that all songs would
   only have a single digit for their minutes. That doesn't work if the
   song lasts longer, such as Pink Floy's 23:88 minute song "Atom Heart
   Mother." You get an error like this:

        Printing total playlist duration...

        Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: ":44"
            at java.base/java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(NumberFormatException.java:65)
            at java.base/java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:652)
            at java.base/java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:770)
            at Playlist.getTotal(Playlist.java:71)
            at PlaylistTester.main(PlaylistTester.java:58)

4. Also, make sure you put your @author and @version information on all
   the files you write--that's important, too, for tracking who wrote
   a file.

Overall your project works decently (with exception of duration issue 
there). During this second semester, you can work on fixing some of 
the detail work in writing your code.

:)

SCORE: 19/20
